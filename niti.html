      <h2>The Composition Of Seawater</h2>
      <p>
        Almost anything can be found in seawater. This includes dissolved
        materials from Earth's crust as will as materials released from
        organisms. The most important components of seawater that influence life
        forms are salinity,temperature,dissolved gases(mostly oxygen and carbon
        dioxide),nutrients, and PH. These elements vary imn their composition as
        well as in their influence on marine life
